# Fixtures

The fixtures framework provides an agnostic way to declare component fixtures that can then be adapted via runtime configuration to the fixture rendering environment of choice.

To use the framework for defining fixtures, import the [`fixtures()`](/docs/testing-fixtures-exports-fixtures--page) method. You can configure the framework for your specific environment (such as Storybook) using the [`setupFixtures()`](/docs/testing-fixtures-exports-setupfixtures--page) method.

An adapter to output fixtures for [Storybook](/docs/testing-fixtures-exports-fixtureadapters--page) is included.

Some examples of this framework in use with Storybook can be seen [here](/docs/testing-fixtures-basic--f-1).

Types are also exported to enable the creation of adapters for other environments as you may need.
