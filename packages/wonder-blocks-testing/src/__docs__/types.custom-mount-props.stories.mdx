# CustomMountProps&lt;&gt;

```ts
type CustomMountProps<TProps: {...}> = {|
    /**
     * The fixture props for the component to be rendered.
     */
    props: TProps,

    /**
     * The component to render.
     */
    component: React.ComponentType<TProps>,

    /**
     * The log callback for logging information.
     */
    log: (message: string, ...args: Array<any>) => mixed,
|};
```

When creating a new adapter instance, the [`FixtureAdapterFactory`](/docs/testing-fixtures-types-fixtureadapterfactory--page) can take an optional component to be used as the root component for each fixture, also know as the mounting component.

The `CustomMountProps<>` type defines the props that will be applied to that mounting component. It includes the `component` to be rendered as the fixture, the `props` to pass to that component, and the `log` callback, which the mounting component can use for any logging it may require.
