# setupFixtures()

setupFixtures<TAdapterOptions: {...}, TAdapterExports: {...}>(
    configuration: $ReadOnly<
        FixturesConfiguration<TAdapterOptions, TAdapterExports>,
    >,
);
```

This method configures the fixtures framework so that it can adapt defined fixtures to the framework that is to be supported. The configuration is of type [`FixturesConfiguration`](/docs/testing-fixtures-types-fixturesconfiguration--page).
