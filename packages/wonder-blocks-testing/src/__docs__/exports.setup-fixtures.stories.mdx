# setupFixtures()

```ts
setupFixtures<TAdapterOptions: {...}, TAdapterExports: {...}>(
    configuration: $ReadOnly<Configuration<TAdapterOptions, TAdapterExports>>,
));
```

This method configures the fixtures framework so that it can adapt defined fixtures to the framework that is to be supported. The configuration is of type [`Configuration`](/docs/testing-types-configuration--page).
