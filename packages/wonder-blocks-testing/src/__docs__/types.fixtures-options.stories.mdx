# FixturesOptions

```ts
type FixturesOptions<TProps: {...}> = {|
    /**
     * The component being tested by the fixtures.
     */
    component: React.ComponentType<TProps>,

    /**
     * Optional title of the fixture collection.
     *
     * Adapters may enforce a title, otherwise the component name is used.
     */
    title?: string,

    /**
     * Optional description of the fixture collection.
     */
    description?: string,

    /**
     * Optional default wrapper to apply around the component under test.
     */
    defaultWrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>,

    /**
     * Additional options to apply to specific adapters.
     */
    additionalAdapterOptions?: FixturesAdapterOptions,
|};
```

This type is used to pass options to the [`fixtures()`](/docs/testing-fixtures-types-fixturesoptions--page) method when describing fixtures for a specific component.

It specifies the `component` being rendered and tested by each fixtures. Optionally, it can also specify a `title` and `description` for the fixtures, as well as a `defaultWrapper` component to use by default to wrap the component under test for each fixture, and an `additionalAdapterOptions` object that allows each adapter type to be individually configured for the fixtures.

If the `title` is omitted, the adapter can either request a default title, which will be based off the name of the `component` React component, or it can provide its own title based as necessary. For example, Storybook has a default title based off the file location of the component when the `title` is omitted.

Some adapters may ignore the `description` field.
