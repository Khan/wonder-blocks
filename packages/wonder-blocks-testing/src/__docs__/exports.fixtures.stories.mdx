# fixtures()

```ts
type FixtureProps<TProps: {...}> =
    | $ReadOnly<TProps>
    | ((options: $ReadOnly<GetPropsOptions>) => $ReadOnly<TProps>);

fixtures<TProps: {...}>(
    component: React.ComponentType<TProps>,
    fn: (
        fixture: (
            description: string,
            props: FixtureProps<TProps>,
            wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>,
        ) => void,
    ) => void,
): ?$ReadOnly<mixed>;


fixtures<TProps: {...}>(
    options: $ReadOnly<FixturesOptions<TProps>>,
    fn: (
        fixture: (
            description: string,
            props: FixtureProps<TProps>,
            wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>,
        ) => void,

The `fixtures()` method is used to define a set of fixtures for a component. Fixtures are like stories in Storybook (and, if the fixtures framework is configured for storybook, will be stories). The return value provides the module exports that your fixture file should export. If your build system supports CommonJS syntax, this can be exported using `module.exports = returnValue`; however, if you need to use ESM syntax, you may need to do something like we do in [our Fixtures Framework example stories](/docs/testing-fixtures-basic--f-1).

There are two ways to call the `fixtures()` function; with a component and callback, or with a set of [options](/docs/testing-types-fixtureoptions--page) and callback.

The second argument is a callback in which you should define your fixture susing the passed `fixture` function (the first and only argument of the callback). The `fixture` function takes two or three arguments:

- `description: string`: A string describing the fixture. This should be used to explain what the fixture is expected to show.
- `props: FixtureProps<TProps>`: The props that the fixture should be rendered with. This can be either a plain object, or a function that returns a plain object. The function will be called with an API to assist in generating the props (see [`GetPropsOptions`](/docs/testing-types-getpropsoptions--page)).
- `wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>`: An optional component that will be rendered around the fixture. This can be used to wrap the fixture in a component that adds additional functionality, such as a test harness (see [`makeTestHarness`](/docs/testing-exports-maketestharness--page)).
