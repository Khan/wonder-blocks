# fixtures()

```ts
type FixtureProps<TProps: {...}> =
    | $ReadOnly<TProps>
    | ((options: $ReadOnly<GetPropsOptions>) => $ReadOnly<TProps>);

fixtures<
    TComponent: React.ComponentType<any>,
    TProps: React.ElementConfig<TComponent>,
>(
    Component: TComponent,
): (
    description: string,
    props: FixtureProps<TProps>,
    wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>,
) => void;
```

The `fixtures()` method is used to define a set of fixtures for a component. Each fixture is a story compatible with the CSF format used by Storybook.

The method returned by `fixtures(Component)` is a strongly-typed call for generating a named story with the given args, and using the given wrapper component, if provided. See [our Fixtures Framework example stories](/docs/testing-fixtures-basic--f-1) for examples.

The `fixture` function takes two or three arguments:

- `description: string`: A string describing the fixture. This should be used to explain what the fixture is expected to show.
- `props: FixtureProps<TProps>`: The props that the fixture should be rendered with. This can be either a plain object, or a function that returns a plain object. The function will be called with an API to assist in generating the props (see [`GetPropsOptions`](/docs/testing-fixtures-types-getpropsoptions--page)).
- `wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>`: An optional component that will be rendered around the fixture. This can be used to wrap the fixture in a component that adds additional functionality, such as a test harness (see [`makeTestHarness`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-maketestharness--page)).
