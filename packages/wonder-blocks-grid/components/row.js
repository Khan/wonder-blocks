 * to ensure that no impossible layouts are accidentally generated.
 *
 * Typically this component will be used as a child of a [Grid](#grid-1),
 * but it's not a requirement, you can use it as a descendant, as well.
 *
 * By default (with no properties specified) it will display at all
 * grid sizes. If you specify the `small`, `medium`, or `large`
 * props then the component will only be shown at those grid sizes.
