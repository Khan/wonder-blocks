/**
 * The `UniqueIDProvider` component is how Wonder Blocks components obtain
 * unique identifiers. This component ensures that server-side rendering and
 * initial client rendering match while allowing the provision of unique
 * identifiers for the client.
 *
 * In all but the first render, the children are rendered with the same
 * `IIdentifierFactory` instance, ensuring that the same calls will return the
 * same identifiers.
 *
 * The `get` method of the identifier factory ensures that the same identifier
 * is returned for like requests, but also that all identifiers provided are
 * unique. Therefore, `get("test")` will always equal `get("test")`, and
 * `get("test2")` will always equal `get("test2")`, but `get("test")` will
 * never equal `get("test2")`.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import {UniqueIDProvider} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-core";
 *
 * <UniqueIDProvider mockOnFirstRender={false} scope="field">
 *  {(ids) => (
 *     <>The id returned for "my-identifier": {ids.get("my-identifier")}</>
 *  )}
 * </UniqueIDProvider>
 * ```
