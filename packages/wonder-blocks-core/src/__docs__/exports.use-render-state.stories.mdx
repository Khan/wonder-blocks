# useRenderState()

```ts
function useRenderState(): RenderState;
```

The `useRenderState` hook will return either:
- `RenderState.Initial` if the component is being rendered on the server **or** it's
  the initial rehydration render on the client.
- `RenderState.Standard` if the component renders on the client after the initial
  rehydration.

NOTE: Although the `RenderState` enum has a third state `Root`, this value is never
returned by `useRenderState`.
