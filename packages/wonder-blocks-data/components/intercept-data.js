/**
 * This component provides a mechanism to intercept the data requests for the
 * type of a given handler and provide alternative results. This is mostly
 * useful for testing.
 *
 * Results from this interceptor will end up in the cache. If you
 * wish to only override the cache, use `InterceptCache` instead.
 *
 * This component is not recommended for use in production code as it
 * can prevent predictable functioning of the Wonder Blocks Data framework.
 * One possible side-effect is that inflight requests from the interceptor could
 * be picked up by `Data` component requests of the same handler type from
 * outside the children of this component.
 *
 * These components do not chain. If a different `InterceptData` instance is
 * rendered within this one that intercepts the same handler type, then that
 * new instance will replace this interceptor for its children. All methods
 * will be replaced.
