# purgeSharedCache()

```ts
purgeSharedCache(scope?: string): void;
```

The `purgeSharedCache` method can be used to clear the shared in-memory cache used by the [`useSharedCache`](/docs/data-exports-usesharedcache--page) hook. Either a single scope or all scopes can be cleared.

Common uses for calling this method are during [server-side rendering](/docs/data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--page) to ensure each render cycle remains isolated, or during testing in a `beforeEach` to cover for where previous test cases may have changed the shared cache.
