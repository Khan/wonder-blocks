# initializeHydrationCache()

```ts
initializeHydrationCache(sourceCache: ResponseCache): void;
```

| Argument | Flow&nbsp;Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sourceData` | `ResponseCache` | _Required_ | The source cache that will be used to initialize the response cache. |

Wonder Blocks Data caches data in its response cache for hydration. This cache can be initialized with data using the `initializeHydrationCache` method.
The `initializeHydrationCache` method can only be called when the hydration cache is empty.

Usually, the data to be passed to `v` will be obtained by calling [`fetchTrackedRequests`](/docs/data-exports-fetchtrackedrequests--page) after tracking data requests (see [`TrackData`](/docs/data-exports-trackdata--page)) during server-side rendering.

Combine with [`purgeHydrationCache`](/docs/data-exports-purgehydrationcache--page) to support your testing needs.

More details about server-side rendering with Wonder Blocks Data can be found in the [relevant overview section](/docs/data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--page).
