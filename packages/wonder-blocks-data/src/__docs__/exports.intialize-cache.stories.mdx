# initializeCache()

```ts
initializeCache(sourceCache: ResponseCache): void;
```

| Argument | Flow&nbsp;Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sourceData` | `ResponseCache` | _Required_ | The source cache that will be used to initialize the response cache. |

Wonder Blocks Data caches data in its response cache for hydration. This cache can be initialized with data using the `initializeCache` method.
The `initializeCache` method can only be called when the hydration cache is empty.

Usually, the data to be passed to `initializeCache` will be obtained by calling [`fulfillAllDataRequests`](/docs/data-exports-fulfillalldatarequests--page) after tracking data requests (see [`TrackData`](/docs/data-exports-trackdata--page)) during server-side rendering.

Combine with [`removeFromCache`](/docs/data-exports-removefromcache--page) or [`removeAllFromCache`](/docs/data-exports-removeallfromcache--page) to support your testing needs.

More details about server-side rendering with Wonder Blocks Data can be found in the [relevant overview section](/docs/data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--page).
