# hasUnfulfilledRequests()

```ts
hasUnfulfilledRequests(): boolean;
```

When performing server-side rendering (SSR), any requests that have been tracked will cause this method to return `true`. Once [`fulfillAllDataRequests`](/docs/data-exports-fulfillalldatarequests--page) has been called and the promise is settled, this method will return `false` to indicate that there are no more pending requests.

More details about server-side rendering with Wonder Blocks Data can be found in the [relevant overview section](/docs/data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--page).
