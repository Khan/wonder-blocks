# GqlRouter

The `GqlRouter` component is used to define the default context and fetch function for performing GraphQL requests using the Wonder Blocks Data API.

The [`useGql`](/docs/data-exports-usegql--page) (and therefore any hooks or components that use it) requires at least one `GqlRouter` in the component hierarchy above it or it will throw an error.

The `defaultContext` is specific to the needs of your specific implementation, as is the `fetch` function. Currently, a default for the fetch function is not provided by Wonder Blocks Data and should be written to the specification of the server that will fulfill your GraphQL responses. The `fetch` function must conform to the [`GqlFetchFn<>`](/docs/data-types-gqlfetchfn--page) type.

```tsx
<GqlRouter defaultContext={{a: "1", b: "2"}} fetch={gqlFetchFn}>
    <div>
        The code that will ultimately use Wonder Blocks Data-based GraphQL
        operations goes here.
    </div>
</GqlRouter>
```
