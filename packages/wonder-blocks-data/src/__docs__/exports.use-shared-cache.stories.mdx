# useSharedCache()

```ts
function useSharedCache<TValue: ValidCacheData>(
    id: string,
    scope: string,
    initialValue?: ?TValue | (() => ?TValue),
): [?TValue, CacheValueFn<TValue>];
```

The `useSharedCache` hook provides access to a shared in-memory cache. This cache is not part of the cache hydrated by Wonder Blocks Data, so [`clearSharedCache`](/docs/data-exports-clearsharedcache--page) must be called between server-side render cycles.

The hook returns a tuple of the currently cached value, or `null` if none is cached, and a function that can be used to set the cached value.

The shared cache is passive and as such does not notify of changes to its contents.

Each cached item is identified by an id and a scope. The scope is used to group items. Whole scopes can be cleared by specifying the specific scope when calling [`clearSharedCache`](/docs/data-exports-clearsharedcache--page).

An optional argument, `initialValue` can be given. This can be either the value to be cached itself or a function that returns the value to be cached  (functions themselves are not valid cachable values). This allows for expensive initialization to only occur when it is necessary.
