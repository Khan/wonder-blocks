# FetchPolicy

```ts
export const FetchPolicy = {
    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, fetch from the server.
     */
    CacheBeforeNetwork: 0,

    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; always fetch from the server
     * regardless of cache.
     */
    CacheAndNetwork: 1,

    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, do nothing.
     */
    CacheOnly: 2,

    /**
     * Ignore any existing cached result; fetch from the server.
     */
    NetworkOnly: 3,
};
```

The `FetchPolicy` type is used with our request framework to define how a request should be fulfilled with respect to the cache and the network.

-   `CacheBeforeNetwork`: If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, fetch from the server.
-   `CacheAndNetwork`: If the data is in the cache, return that; always fetch from the server regardless of cache.
-   `CacheOnly`: If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, do nothing.
-   `NetworkOnly`: Ignore any existing cached result; always fetch from the server.
