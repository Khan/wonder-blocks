# FetchPolicy

```ts
export enum FetchPolicy {
    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, fetch from the server.
     */
    CacheBeforeNetwork,

    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; always fetch from the server
     * regardless of cache.
     */
    CacheAndNetwork,

    /**
     * If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, do nothing.
     */
    CacheOnly,

    /**
     * Ignore any existing cached result; fetch from the server.
     */
    NetworkOnly,
}
```

The `FetchPolicy` type is used with our request framework to define how a request should be fulfilled with respect to the cache and the network.

 * `CacheBeforeNetwork`: If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, fetch from the server.
 * `CacheAndNetwork`:  If the data is in the cache, return that; always fetch from the server regardless of cache.
 * `CacheOnly`: If the data is in the cache, return that; otherwise, do nothing.
 * `NetworkOnly`: Ignore any existing cached result; always fetch from the server.
