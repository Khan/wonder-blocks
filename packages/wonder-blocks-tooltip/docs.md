Use a tooltip to help describe an on screen object.

Tooltips:

- contain text
- (optional) contain small graphic elements to complement the text
- appear on hover or focus (for non-assistive tech keyboard users)
- must have a tail that points to a parent object
- DO NOT include actions

For more rich content see Popovers, for taking action on an object, see Snackbars (proposed).
