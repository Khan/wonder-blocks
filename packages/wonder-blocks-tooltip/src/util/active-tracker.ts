/**
 * This class is used to track the concept of active state (though technically
 * that could be any boolean state). The tracker has a variety of subscribers
 * that receive notifications of state theft and can steal the state.
 *
 * For the tooltip, this enables us to have a single tooltip active at any one
 * time. The tracker allows tooltip anchors to coordinate which of them is
 * active, and to ensure that if a different one becomes active, all the others
 * know that they aren't.
 *
 * - When notified that the state has been stolen, subscribers can immediately
 * reflect that theft (in the case of a tooltip, they would hide themselves).
 * - The thief does not get notified if they were the one who stole the state
 * since they should already know that they did that (this avoids having to have
 * checks for reentrancy, for example).
 * - When the subscriber that owns the state no longer needs it, it can
 * voluntarily give it up.
 * - If the state is stolen while a subscriber owns the
 * state, that subscriber does not give up the state, as it doesn't have it
 * anymore (it was stolen).
