/**
 * An IconButton is a button whose contents are an SVG image.
 *
 * To use, supply an onClick function, a wonder-blocks icon asset (see
 * the Icon section) and an aria-label to describe the button functionality.
 * Optionally specify href (URL), clientSideNav, color
 * (Wonder Blocks Blue or Red), kind ("primary", "secondary", or "tertiary"),
 * light (whether the IconButton will be rendered on a dark background),
 * disabled , test ID, and custom styling.
 *
 * The size of an IconButton matches the size of icon it wraps which is 24x24
 * pixels.  The focus ring which is displayed on hover and focus is much
 * larger but does not affect its size.  This matches the behavior of Button.
 *
 * IconButtons require a certain amount of space between them to ensure the
 * focus rings don't overlap.  The minimum amount of spacing is 16px, but
 * you should refer to the mocks provided by design.  Using a Strut in between
 * IconButtons is the preferred way to for adding this spacing.
 *
 * Many layouts require alignment of visual left (or right) side of an
 * IconButton.  This requires a little bit of pixel nudging since each icon
 * as a different amount of internal padding.
 *
 * See the Toolbar documentation for examples of IconButton use that follow
 * the best practices described above.
 *
 * ```js
 * import {icons} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon";
 *
 * <IconButton
 *     icon={icons.anIcon}
 *     aria-label="An Icon"
 *     onClick={(e) => console.log("Hello, world!")}
 * />
 * ```
