## Running Callbacks on Navigation

Sometimes you may need to run some code and also navigate when the user
clicks the button. For example, you might want to send a request to the
server and also send the user to a different page. You can do this by
passing in a URL to the `href` prop and also passing in a callback
function to either the `onClick`, `beforeNav`, or `safeWithNav` prop.
Which prop you choose depends on your use case.

- `onClick` is guaranteed to run to completion before navigation starts,
  but it is not async aware, so it should only be used if all of the code
  in your callback function executes synchronously.

- `beforeNav` is guaranteed to run async operations before navigation
  starts. You must return a promise from the callback function passed in
  to this prop, and the navigation will happen after the promise
  resolves. This prop should be used if it's important that the async code
  completely finishes before the next URL starts loading.

- `safeWithNav` runs async code concurrently with navigation when safe,
  but delays navigation until the async code is finished when
  concurrent execution is not safe. You must return a promise from the
  callback function passed in to this prop, and Wonder Blocks will run
  the async code in parallel with client-side navigation or while opening
  a new tab, but will wait until the async code finishes to start a
  server-side navigation. This prop should be used when it's okay to load
  the next URL while the async callback code is running.

This table gives an overview of the options:

| Prop         | Async safe? | Completes before navigation? |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| onClick      | no          | yes                          |
| beforeNav    | yes         | yes                          |
| safeWithNav  | yes         | no                           |
