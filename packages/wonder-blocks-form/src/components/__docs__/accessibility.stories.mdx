## Accessibility

### ARIA

`Checkbox` can take in all ARIA props defined in Wonder Blocks Core types.

Elements with role `"checkbox"` can have an `aria-checked` property that
exposes the checked state to assistive technology. The dev does not have
to worry about this because the Wonder Blocks Checkbox component is an
`input` element with type `"checkbox"`, as this has built-in semantics and
does not require ARIA.

When the checkbox is in an error state, `aria-invalid` is set to true.
(More info in the Error section.)
