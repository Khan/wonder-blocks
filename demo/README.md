# wonder-blocks-demo

The purpose of this demo app is to:
- test wonder-blocks components in use cases similar to those in webapp
- test client-side navigation using react-router-dom which doesn't play nicely
  with styleguidist

## quick start
In the parent directory run:
```
npm run watch:all
```
This will create built versions of wonder-blocks components and will watch for
any changes.  This makes testing changes as you play-test components easy.

In a separate terminal run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
