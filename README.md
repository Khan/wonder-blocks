## Contributing

Please note – before contributing ensure that any design changes you are wanting to make are reflected in the [Wonder Blocks project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VbVu3h2BpBhH80niq101MHHE/Wonder-Blocks) or [Zeplin](https://zpl.io/bl1owd1).  We previously used Zeplin, but have since moved to Figma.  Please check Figma first — if a design isn't there please check Zeplin.  Moving forward we will be transitioning away from Zeplin, but in the interim you may need to check both.
