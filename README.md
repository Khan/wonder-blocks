The Khan Academy Wonder Blocks design system. This is work-in-progress and a lot
of things are still in motion.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.JS v10](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v10.18.1/)

## Contributing

**Note for external contributors:** We are not accepting external contributions
at this time. We are working to make this happen in the future, and we will let
you know when this is possible!

For a more detailed explanation about how to develop Wonder Blocks components,
please refer to the [internal documentation](https://khanacademy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FRONTEND/pages/100827261/Developing+wonder-blocks)

Please note – before contributing ensure that any design changes you are wanting
to make are reflected in the [Wonder Blocks project in
Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VbVu3h2BpBhH80niq101MHHE/Wonder-Blocks) or
[Zeplin](https://zpl.io/bl1owd1).  We previously used Zeplin, but have since
moved to Figma.  Please check Figma first — if a design isn't there please check
Zeplin.  Moving forward we will be transitioning away from Zeplin, but in the
interim you may need to check both.
