## Image Comparison Tests

These tests live in the fixtures folder.  They use a tool called vite which at the
moment must be installed separately by cloning git@github.com:khan/vite/ and running
yarn link.  Then you'll be able to run vite from the wonder-blocks folder.  Once you
do, open your favorite web browser to localhost:3000.
