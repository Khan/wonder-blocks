# IMPORTANT! We set concurrency to this workflow and the branch (github.ref),

# for the same PR at the same time (potentially publishing an earlier commit as
# "latest" and causing confusion).
#
# We also do not want to cancel in-progress runs, because we don't want a
# production publish to be interrupted by a snapshot publish ever.

  # This workflow will run changesets depending on two different scenarios:
  #
  # 1. If we are landing a specific commit into main (Author PR), then
  #    changesets will check if there are changes verifying the Markdown files
  #    generated automatically:
  #
  #    a) There are new versions and there's NO Release PR, then the changesets
  #    action will create a new Release PR.
  #
  #    b) There's a Release PR, then the changesets action will update the
  #    existing Release PR with the new commit.
  #
  #    NOTE: (in both cases, changesets will modify the new version in
  #    package.json for each package, and will remove the MD files as part of the
  #    Release PR).
  #
  # 2. If we are landing the Release PR into main, then the changesets action
  #    will publish the changes to npm.

            You can install the packages in `frontend` by running:

            steps.publish-snapshot.outputs.npm_snapshot_tag }}"
            ```

            Packages can also be installed manually by running:
            ```sh
            pnpm add @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-<package-name>@${{
            steps.publish-snapshot.outputs.npm_snapshot_tag }}
