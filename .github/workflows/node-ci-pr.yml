# Our jobs run like this to minimize wasting resource cycles:
#   1. Prime caches for primary configuration (ubuntu on node 16).
#      This way the next two jobs can run in parallel but rely on this primed
#      cache.
#   2. Lint and Test
#     a. Lint
#     b. Test/Coverage
#   3. Verify that build sizes are reasonable

            ## npm Snapshot: Published
            ðŸŽ‰ Good news!! We've packaged up the latest commit from this PR (${{
            steps.short-sha.outputs.short_sha }}) and published all packages with changesets to npm.

            You can install the packages in webapp by running:
            ```sh
            ./services/static/dev/tools/deploy_wonder_blocks.js --tag="${{
            steps.publish-snapshot.outputs.npm_snapshot_tag }}"
            ```

            Packages can also be installed manually by running:
            ```sh
            pnpm add @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-<package-name>@${{
            steps.publish-snapshot.outputs.npm_snapshot_tag }}
            ```

              ðŸ¤• Oh noes!! We couldn't find any changesets in this PR (${{
              steps.short-sha.outputs.short_sha }}). As a result, we did **not** publish an npm snapshot for you.

                ðŸ¤• Oh noes!! We couldn't publish an npm snapshot for you because
                there is a release in progress. Please wait for the release to
                finish, then retry this workflow.
