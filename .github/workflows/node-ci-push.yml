# Our jobs run like this to minimize wasting resource cycles:
#   1. Prime caches for primary configuration (ubuntu on node 14).
#      This way the next two jobs can run in parallel but rely on this primed
#      cache.
#   2. Coverage
#   3. Chromatic autoApprove on squash commits
#
# For pushes directly to a branch, we assume a PR has been used with wider
# checks, this just makes sure our coverage data is up-to-date.
