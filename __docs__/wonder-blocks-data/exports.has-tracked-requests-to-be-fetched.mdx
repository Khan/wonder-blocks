# hasTrackedRequestsToBeFetched()

```ts
hasTrackedRequestsToBeFetched(): boolean;
```

When performing server-side rendering (SSR), any requests that have been tracked will cause this method to return `true`. Once <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-fetchtrackedrequests--docs">`fetchTrackedRequests`</a> has been called and the promise is settled, this method will return `false` to indicate that there are no more pending requests.

More details about server-side rendering with Wonder Blocks Data can be found in the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--docs">relevant overview section</a>.
