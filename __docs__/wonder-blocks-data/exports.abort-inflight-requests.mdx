# abortInflightRequests()

```ts
abortInflightRequests(): void;
```

Aborts all inflight requests that were started via [`useCachedEffect`](/docs/data-exports-usecachedeffect--page), [`useHydratableEffect`](/docs/data-exports-usehydratableeffect--page), or [`fetchTrackedRequests()`](/docs/data-exports-fetchtrackedrequests--page).

NOTE: Full abort signalling is not currently implemented. The effect of this call is to remove any inflight requests from our inflight request tracking such that a new matching request will cause a new fetch to occur rather than sharing any existing one.
