# abortInflightRequests()

```ts
abortInflightRequests(): void;
```

Aborts all inflight requests that were started via <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-usecachedeffect--docs">`useCachedEffect`</a>, <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-usehydratableeffect--docs">`useHydratableEffect`</a>, or <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-fetchtrackedrequests--docs">`fetchTrackedRequests()`</a>.

NOTE: Full abort signalling is not currently implemented. The effect of this call is to remove any inflight requests from our inflight request tracking such that a new matching request will cause a new fetch to occur rather than sharing any existing one.
