# ResponseCache

```ts
type ResponseCache = {
    [key: string]: CachedResponse<any>,
    ...
};
```

`ResponseCache` describes the serialized cache that is used to hydrate responses. An example of a valid `ResponseCache` instance is shown below. Generally, you would not generate this object directly, but rather use the returned data from <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-fetchtrackedrequests--docs">`fetchTrackedRequests`</a>.

```ts
const responseCache: ResponseCache = {
    DATA_ID_1: {error: "It go ðŸ’¥boom ðŸ˜¢"},
    DATA_ID_2: {data: ["array", "of", "data"]},
    DATA_ID_3: {data: {some: "data"}},
};
```

In this example, the cache contains data retrieved for three different requests.

Each entry in the cache is of type <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-types-cachedresponse--docs">`CachedResponse`</a>. See the section on <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--docs">server-side rendering</a> for more information.
