# CachedResponse\<>

```ts
type CachedResponse<TData: ValidCacheData> =
    | {|
          +error: string,
          +data?: void,
      |}
    | {|
          +data: TData,
          +error?: void,
      |};
```

`CachedResponse<>` is a special union type that is used to represent the serialized result of a request, which can be used by Wonder Blocks Data to
hydrate the response.
