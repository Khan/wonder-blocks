# GqlOperation\<>

```ts
type GqlOperation<
    TData,
    TVariables: {...} = Empty,
> = {
    type: GqlOperationType,
    id: string,
    [key: string]: mixed,
    ...
};
```

The `GqlOperation<>` type provides the Wonder Blocks Data definition of a GraphQL query or mutation. It has two required fields:

* `type`: The type of operation. It can be either `"query"` or `"mutation"`.
* `id`: The unique identifier of the operation.

Unlike some GraphQL clients, the definition of the operation (the document node, for example) is not required by the Wonder Blocks Data implementation. If a specific use requires that information, the calling code is able to provide it.

Consider the following GraphQL query (using `graphql-tag`):

```ts
const MyQuery = gql`
    query myQuery {
        user {
            id
            name
        }
    }
`;
```

Rather than using the full `DocumentNode` at runtime, one could envisage a build step that converts it to a `GqlOperation<>` at compile time by parsing the `DocumentNode` to determine the operation type and extract the name of the operation. If the actual definition is needed for sending to the server in the request, this can be obtained from `graphql/language/printer`. This would then reduce the dependencies needed to perform GraphQL operations at runtime.

The resulting `GqlOperation<>` would look like this:

```ts
{
    type: "query",
    id: "myQuery",
}
```

Or, if say, the query definition were needed (for example, Apollo will send requests with the `query` field):

```ts
{
    type: "query",
    id: "myQuery",
    query: "query myQuery { user { id name } }",
}
```
