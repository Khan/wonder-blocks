# purgeCaches()

```ts
purgeCaches(scope?: string): void;
```

The `purgeCaches` method will purge the following caches managed by Wonder Blocks Data:

-   Shared in-memory cache as used by <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-usesharedcache--docs">`useSharedCache`</a> and other hooks
-   Hydration cache as used during server-side rendering

This is equivalent to calling both `SharedCache.purgeAll()` and `purgeHydrationCache()`, and is especially useful when writing tests or setting up a test environment.
