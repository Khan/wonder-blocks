# purgeCaches()

```ts
purgeCaches(scope?: string): void;
```

The `purgeCaches` method will purge the following caches managed by Wonder Blocks Data:

* Shared in-memory cache as used by [`useSharedCache`](/docs/data-exports-usesharedcache--page) and other hooks
* Hydration cache as used during server-side rendering

This is equivalent to calling both `SharedCache.purgeAll()` and `purgeHydrationCache()`, and is especially useful when writing tests or setting up a test environment.
