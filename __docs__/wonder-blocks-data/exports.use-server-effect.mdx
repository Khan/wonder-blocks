# useServerEffect()

```ts
function useServerEffect<TData: ValidCacheData>(
    requestId: string,
    handler: () => Promise<TData>,
    options?: ServerEffectOptions,
): ?Result<TData>;
```

The `useServerEffect` hook is an integral part of server-side rendering. It has different behavior depending on whether it is running on the server (and in what context) or the client.

```ts
type ServerEffectOptions = {|
    skip?: boolean,
    hydrate?: boolean,
|};
```

| Option    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hydrate` | `true`  | When `true`, the result of the effect when fulfilled using Wonder Blocks Data will be stored in the hydration cache for hydrating client-side; otherwise, the result will be stored in the server-side-only cache. |
| `skip`    | `false` | When `true`, the effect will not be tracked for fulfillment; otherwise, the effect will be tracked for fulfillment.                                                                                                |

## Server-side behavior

First, this hook checks the server-side rendering cache for the request identifier; if it finds a cached value, it will return that.

If there is no cached value, it will return a "loading" state. In addition, if the current rendering component has a <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-trackdata--docs">`TrackData`</a> ancestor, `useServerEffect` will register the request for fulfillment.

This then allows that pending request to be fulfilled with <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-fetchtrackddatarequests--docs">`fetchTrackedRequests`</a>, the response to be placed into the cache, and the render to be reexecuted, at which point, this hook will be able to provide that result instead of "loading.

More details about server-side rendering with Wonder Blocks Data can be found in the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-server-side-rendering-and-hydration--docs">relevant overview section</a>.

## Client-side behavior

On initial render in the client, this hook will look for a corresponding value in the Wonder Blocks Data hydration cache. If there is one, it will delete it from the hydration cache and return that value.

Otherwise, it will return `null`.
