# GqlFetchFn\<>

```ts
type GqlFetchFn<TData, TVariables: {...}, TContext: GqlContext> = (
    operation: GqlOperation<TData, TVariables>,
    variables: ?TVariables,
    context: TContext,
) => Promise<Response>;
```

The `GqlFetchFn<>` type describes the function that will perform a GraphQL request. A function that fits this signature is configured in Wonder Blocks Data using the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-gqlrouter--docs">`GqlRouter`</a> component. The <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-usegql--docs">`useGql`</a> hook and derivatives are then built on top of this to abstract away complexities, such as converting the `Response` to a valid <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-types-result--docs">`Result<>`</a> instance, as various use cases see fit.

See the section on <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-graphql--docs">GraphQL</a> for more information.
