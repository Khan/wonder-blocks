## Accordion Accessibility

### Built in Accessibility Features

Wonder Blocks Accordion already has some built in accessibility features
as [advised by W3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).

- The headers of each section are button components. The user can click on
  the header to expand the section. The user can also use the enter or
  space keys when focused on the header to expand the section.
- The headers are keyboard navigable:
  - The "tab" key and "arrow down" keys will focus on the next header
    in the sequence. ("Arrow down" only works if the focus is already
    within the accordion, and will cycle to the top if the focus is
    currently on the last element.)
  - The "shift + tab" and "arrow up" keys will focus on the previous
    header in the sequence. ("Arrow up" only works if the focus is
    already within the accordion, and will cycle to the bottom if
    the focus is currently on the first element.)
  - The "home" key will focus on the first header in the accordion.
  - The "end" key will focus on the last header in the accordion.
- The roles and structures are set as advised:
  - The title of each header is contained within a button.
  - The title button is wrapped in a heading.
      - It is currently `<h2>` by default, but the user is advised to
        set it to the appropriate heading level via the `tag` prop on
        each accordion section.
  - The header button has the `aria-expanded` attribute, which is
    true when the accordion section is expanded and false when not.
  - The header button has the `aria-controls` attribute pointing to
    the ID of that section's content panel container.
  - If the section is not collapsible, the header button has the
    `aria-disabled` attribute set to true.
  - Each section's content panel has its `aria-labelledby` pointing To
    its header button.
  - If there are six or fewer sections, each section's content panel
    has the `role` attribute set to "region".

### Considerations for the User

- The accordion can be animated using the `animated` prop. However,
  PLEASE set this according to the users' "prefers reduced motion"
  setting (this can be in the application or in their operating system).
- PLEASE use AccordionSection's `tag` prop to appropriately set the
  section's heading level! It defaults to `<h2>`, but it needs to be
  set appropriately based on the page's heading structure.
