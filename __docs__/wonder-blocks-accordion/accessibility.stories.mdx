## Accordion Accessibility

### Built in Accessibility Features

Wonder Blocks Accordion already has some built in accessibility features
as [advised by W3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/).

- The headers of each section are button components. The user can click on
  the header or use the enter or space keys when focused on the header to
  expand the section.
