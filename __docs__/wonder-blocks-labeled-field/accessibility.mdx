# LabeledField Accessibility

The `LabeledField` component should be used in forms whenever possible. Benefits
for using this component include:
- Consistent styling for the label, description, and error message
- HTML attributes are wired up automatically for accessibility:
  - A `label` element is used with the `for` attribute set to the
  `id` of the field element
  - The field element will have `aria-describedby` set to the element ids for
  the description and error
- An error icon for the error message so that color isn't the only way to
communicate information. The error icon has an aria-label of `Error:` by default
to prefix the provided error message.
- The error section which includes the icon and text has `aria-live=assertive`
and `aria-atomic=true` so that any updates to the error message are announced to
screen readers.


## Guidelines
- Make sure the `id` prop for `LabeledField` is unique to the page. If the `id`
prop is not provided, a unique id will be auto-generated!
- The `LabeledField` component does not need to be used with the `CheckboxGroup`
 or `RadioGroup` components since those components already have accessible labels
 built-in when the `label` prop is used.

## Screen Reader Behaviour

Since the label, description, and error message are associated with the field,
they are read out with the field when it is interacted with. If the field component
handles the `error` and `required` props and sets the `aria-invalid` and `aria-required`
attributes, then this information is also announced.

### Error messages

The error message is implemented following the
[W3C-WAI Form Notifications On Focus Change](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/notifications/#on-focus-change)
pattern. The field has `aria-describedby` set to the `id` for the error message
and the error message has `aria-live="assertive"`. `aria-atomic=true` is also set
so that any updates to the error message is announced.

Different browsers and screen readers announce this differently unfortunately
(in both the W3 example and LabeledField stories). The following documents the
current behaviour for 3 scenarios around error messages:

#### 1. The field is in an error state already

**Expected:** When a user interacts with the field, it should announce the field
details along with the error message.

**Safari + VoiceOver, Firefox + NVDA, Chrome + NVDA:** Works as expected - field
details are announced (including the error message)

#### 2. There is an error after interacting with a field

**Expected:** When the error message is shown after interacting with a field, it
should announce the error message.

**Safari + VoiceOver:** Announces the error message for SingleSelect and MultiSelect
since the focus is moved to the opener when the options are closed. It does not
announce the error message for TextField, TextArea, and Search Field.
- Mitigation: Since the focus should move to the first field with an error, the
error message will be announced then. Tabbing through the other fields will
read out the error message as expected (see scenario #1).
- Note: [Related Safari Bug around `aria-describedby`](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262895#c22).
We also use `aria-live=assertive` instead of `role=alert` for the error
message because of a different Safari bug where [`aria-describedby` with
`role="alert"` is not announced](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=270943).
By using `aria-live` instead, the error message is announced when the field is
interacted with (scenario #1).


**Firefox + NVDA:** Announces the error as expected when leaving a field. For
SingleSelect and MultiSelect, the error message is announced twice. The first
time, it announces the error message. The second time, it reads out the details
of the field, including the error message.

**Chrome + NVDA:** It announces the error message twice when leaving a field. The
first time, it announces the error message. The second time, it reads out the
details of the field, including the error message.
- Reasoning: This seems to be the behaviour when we set both the field's
`aria-describedby` to the id of the error message and `aria-live=assertive` on
the error message. We need `aria-describedby` set so that the error message is
announced when the field is interacted with (scenario #1). We need the live region
on the error message so that it is announced on blur when using Firefox + NVDA.
- Based on the [Core Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.2/#event-aria-describedby) spec,
user agents must notify assitive technology when `aria-describedby` changes,
though "user agents may trim out change events for state or property changes that
assistive technologies typically ignore, such as events that are happening in a
window that does not currently have focus". Chrome seems to follow this and
treat `aria-describedby` as a live region even when the field is blurred,
while Firefox does not (which could be why Firefox doesn't repeat the field
details). (Note: There is a [bug for the Chromium behaviour](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41449536)
that is marked as "Won't Fix")

#### 3. There is an error after form submission

**Expected:** When an error message is shown after a form is submitted, focus
should be programmatically moved to the first field with an error and the field
details should be announced with the error message.

**Safari + VoiceOver, Firefox + NVDA, Chrome + NVDA:** Works as expected - once
focus is moved to the first field with an error, the field details are read out
along with the error.
