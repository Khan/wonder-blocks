# LabeledField Accessibility

The `LabeledField` component should be used in forms whenever possible. Benefits
for using this component include:
- Consistent styling for the label, description, and error message
- HTML attributes are wired up automatically for accessibility:
  - A `label` element is used with the `for` attribute set to the
  `id` of the field element
  - The field element will have `aria-describedby` set to the element ids for
  the description and error

## Guidelines
- Make sure the `id` prop for `LabeledField` is unique to the page. If the `id`
prop is not provided, a unique id will be auto-generated!
- The `LabeledField` component does not need to be used with the `CheckboxGroup`
 or `RadioGroup` components since those components already have accessible labels
 built-in when the `label` prop is used.
