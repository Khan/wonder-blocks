# IconButton

The `wonder-blocks-icon-button` package provides a set of icon button components
that allow you to create buttons with icons. These buttons are designed to be
accessible and easy to use, with support for keyboard navigation and screen
readers.

For more details about each type of IconButton, refer to the docs for that
component!

## IconButton

A button whose contents are an icon. This is a simple button that can be used to
trigger actions or navigate to other pages. It uses a flat design, our most
common design pattern that can be used across different experiences.
