# TextArea Accessibility

- Use labels for every `TextArea` and make the `for=""` and `id=""` values match.
IDs must be unique on each page, only one label can be associated to each unique
form element.
- Have in mind that placeholder text is not a replacement for labels. Assistive
technologies, such as screen readers, do not treat placeholder text as labels.

## ARIA

`TextArea` can take in all ARIA props defined in Wonder Blocks Core types.

The `aria-invalid` attribute is automatically set to `true`/`false` if it is
in an error state.

## Keyboard Interaction

If the `TextArea` is not disabled, a user can tab to it using standard keyboard
navigation.
