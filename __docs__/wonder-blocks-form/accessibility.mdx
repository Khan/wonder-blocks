# Form Accessibility

## Form Field Labels

Form fields should have an associated `<label>` element that has the `htmlFor`
prop set to the `id` of the form field element. This is helpful for
screenreaders so that it can communicate the relationship between the label and
the form field.

### Guidelines
- Make sure the id of the form field element is unique to the page
- Consider using the `LabeledTextField` component if you are using `TextField`.
This will automatically wire up the label and text input. (Note: we will have
a more generic `LabelField` component later on to provide this functionality
for other form fields.)
- If you are using the `CheckboxGroup` or `RadioGroup` components, the accessible
label for the field is already built-in when the `label` prop is used. This
uses `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements instead of a `<label>` since the label
is for a group of related controls. See
[Grouping Controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/)
for more details!
- When using Wonder Blocks typography components for form labels, the `tag`
prop can be set to `label` to change the underlying element to render.


Here is an example of a form field label using Wonder Blocks components
`LabelMedium` and `TextArea`:
