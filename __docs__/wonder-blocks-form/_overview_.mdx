# Form

`wonder-blocks-form` provides building blocks for Form components, including
TextField, TextArea, Choice, Checkbox, RadioButton, etc.


## Best Practices

### Form Field Labels

- Use form field components with the `LabeledField` component. `LabeledField`
provides a consistent pattern for things like the label,
description, required indicator, and error message for a field. It will also
provide unique ids automatically and wire up the proper attributes for
accessibility. Use `LabeledField` for the following components:
  - `TextField`
  - `TextArea`
  - `SingleSelect`
  - `MultiSelect`
  - `SearchField`
- If you are using the `CheckboxGroup` or `RadioGroup` components, use the
`label` prop for an accessible field label. This uses `<fieldset>` and
`<legend>` elements instead of a `<label>` since the label is for a group of
related controls. See [Grouping Controls](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/grouping/)
for more details!
- For custom implementations of field labels:
  - Make sure the id of the form field element is unique to the page
  - When using Wonder Blocks typography components for the form field label,
  set the `tag` prop to `label` to change the underlying element to render and
  use the `htmlFor` prop. Here is an example of a form field label using Wonder
  Blocks components `LabelMedium` and `TextArea`:

<Canvas of={AccessibilityStories.FormLabelExample} />

### Error Validation

- For fields like `TextField`, `TextArea`, and `SearchField` prefer setting
`instantValidation=false`. This makes it so validation occurs on blur after a
user is done interacting with a field.
- Avoid disabling form submission buttons. There could be exceptions if the
button is for one field.
- If there are errors after a form is submitted, programatically move the user's
focus to the first field with an error
