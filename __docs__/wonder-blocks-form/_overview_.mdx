# Form

`wonder-blocks-form` provides building blocks for Form components, including
TextField, TextArea, Choice, Checkbox, RadioButton, etc.


## Best Practices

- Use form field components with the `LabeledField` component. `LabeledField`
provides a consistent pattern for things like the label,
description, required indicator, and error message for a field. It will also
wire up the proper attributes for accessibility. Use `LabeledField` for the
following components:
  - `TextField`
  - `TextArea`
  - `SingleSelect`
  - `MultiSelect`
  - `SearchField`
- For fields like `TextField` and `TextArea`, prefer setting `instantValidation=false`.
This makes it so validation occurs on blur after a user is done interacting with
a field.
- Avoid disabling form submission buttons. There could be exceptions if the
button is for one field.
- If there are errors after a form is submitted, programatically move the user's
focus to the first field with an error
