## Accessibility

### ARIA

`Checkbox` can take in all ARIA props defined in Wonder Blocks Core types.

Elements with role `"checkbox"` can have an `aria-checked` property that
exposes the checked state to assistive technology. The dev does not have
to worry about this because the Wonder Blocks Checkbox component is an
`input` element with type `"checkbox"`, as this has built-in semantics and
does not require ARIA.

The current implementation of `Checkbox` uses `aria-describedby` with the
label and description that may be passed in as props.

See the Error section for information about `aria-invalid` and
`aria-required`.

### Error state

The Wonder Blocks `Checkbox` component takes an `error` boolean prop. Setting
this prop to true will set `aria-invalid` to true, and the color of the
checkbox to red.

When a form input is invalid, the user should provide a reason for why
this is.

Generally, it is also suggested this is the validation error message is
passed to the checkbox's `aria-describedby` prop so assistive tech can
read it. However, this is not possible with the current implementation of
the Wonder Blocks Form Checkbox component.

The error state can be used to signal that a required checkbox has not been
checked. In cases where a checkbox is required, the checkbox component should
set the `aria-required` prop to true for assistive tech.
There should also be some sort of visual indication that checking
the box is required, such as a "Required" label or an asterisk.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Error state"
        args={{
            label: "I accept the terms and conditions",
        }}
    >
        {ErrorTemplate.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled state

The Wonder Blocks `Checkbox` compoenent takes a `disabled` boolean prop.
This sets the underlying `input` element's `disabled` prop to `true`.
This makes is so that the checkbox is not interactable. Also, assistive
tech will indicated that the checkbox is dimmed.

A user will not be able to navigate to the checkbox with a keyboard.
Screen reader users will be able to navigate to the checkbox with
screen reader controls.

It is suggested that if an element is disabled, an explanation as to why
should to provided somewhere.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Disabled state">{DisabledTemplate.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Keyboard Interaction

If a checkbox is not disabled, a user can tab to it using standard
keyboard navigation. The Space key toggles the checked state of the checkbox.

Note the the Space key triggers the `onChange` function of the
Wonder Blocks Checkbox component. If the user does not specify an `onChange`
funciton prop that in turn updates the value of `checked`, neither clicking
nor the Space key will toggle the Checkbox.
