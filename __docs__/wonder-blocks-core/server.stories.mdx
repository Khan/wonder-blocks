# Server

Provides helpers for switching to server-side mode and determining if server-side mode is in use.
This API is valuable when performing server-side rendering actions.

## setServerSide

When called, server-side mode is turned on. Once turned on, it cannot be turned off.
This causes additinal features to be available in some Wonder Blocks packages that are otherwise ignored.

### Usage

```js
import {Server} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-core";

Server.setServerSide(): void;
```

## isServerSide

This returns `false` unless `setServerSide` has been called. It is used to determine
if server-side-only features and behaviors should be enabled.

### Usage

```js
import {Server} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-core";

Server.isServerSide(): boolean;
```
