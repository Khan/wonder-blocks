# useForceUpdate()

```ts
function useForceUpdate(): () => void;
```

The `useForceUpdate` hook returns a function that can be called to force a component to re-render. This is usually not needed as you should be using `useState` or `useReducer` to manage state and rendering in your component (along with `useCallback` and `useMemo` as necessary). However, there maybe times where caching is used to avoid state. In those cases, the `useForceUpdate` hook can be used to force a re-render upon cached data changing or some other triggering event.
