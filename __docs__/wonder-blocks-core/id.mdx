# Id

`Id` is a component that provides an identifier to its children.

It is useful for situations where the `useId` hook cannot be easily used,
such as in class-based components.

If an `id` prop is provided, that is passed through to the children;
otherwise, a unique identifier is generated.

## Usage

```tsx
import {Id} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-core";

<Id id={maybeId}>{(id) => <div id={id}>Hello, world!</div>}</Id>;
```

## Examples

### 1. Generating an id

An identifier will always be generated if an `id` prop is not provided, or the
provided `id` property is falsy.

<Canvas withSource="open" of={IdStories.GeneratedIdExample} />

### 2. Passthrough an id

If an `id` prop is provided and it is truthy, that value will be passed through
to the children.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={IdStories.PassedThroughIdExample} />
