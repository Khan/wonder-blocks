# useRenderState()

```ts
function useRenderState(): RenderState;
```

The `useRenderState` hook will return either:

-   `RenderState.Initial` if the component is being rendered on the server **or** it's
    the initial rehydration render on the client.
-   `RenderState.Standard` if the component renders on the client after the initial
    rehydration.
