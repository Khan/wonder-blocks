# useIsomorphicLayoutEffect()

```ts
function useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(
    effect: EffectCallback,
    deps?: DependencyList,
): void);
```

The `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` hook is a drop-in replacement for the `useLayoutEffect` hook. It works exactly the same when clientside, but is a no-op on the server. It is useful for when you need to perform side-effects clientside after mounting, but you don't want to break server-side rendering.

When using `eslint`, you can get exhaustive dependency checks for this hook by updating your configuration for the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule:

For example:
```json
{
    "rules": {
        "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": [
            "error",
            {
                "additionalHooks": "(useIsomorphicLayoutEffect)"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
