# Accessibility for TabsDropdown

## Guidelines

- Set the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop to provide an accessible name
for the tabs region. If there is a visible label for the tabs, use
`aria-labelledby` to reference it. Otherwise, use `aria-label` to provide a
descriptive label.

## About the Implementation

The `TabsDropdown` component uses the Wonder Blocks `ActionMenu` and `ActionItem`
components internally. The semantics, attributes, and keyboard interactions are
inherited from these components.

Note: For the horizontal tabs pattern implementation, see the `Tabs` component.

### HTML Semantics and Attributes

The following semantics are used:

- The root container is a `region` landmark with the provided `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` value
- The tab panel has `role="group"` with `aria-labelledby` pointing to the opener
button
- For more details about the semantics around the dropdown, see the `ActionMenu`
component.

The following attributes are implemented:

- `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on the root container to provide an
accessible name for the tabs region
- `aria-labelledby` on the tab panel pointing to the opener button
- - For more details about the semantics around the dropdown, see the `ActionMenu`
component.

### Keyboard Interactions

The component inherits keyboard navigation from `ActionMenu`.

### Focus Management

When a tab is selected from the dropdown menu, focus returns to the opener
button. The opener button label is updated to the name of the selected tab.
