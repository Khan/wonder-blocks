# Accessibility for Tabs

## Guidelines
- If there is a visible label for the tabs, set the `aria-labelledby` prop to
the id of the label. If there isn't, set the `aria-label` prop
- Make sure the ids for the tabs are unique. They are used to associate the tabs
and tab panels together

## About the Implementation

The Tabs component follows the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) Tabs
Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/).

### HTML Semantics and Attributes

The following semantics are used:
- A `button` element with `role=tab` is used to control which tab panel is shown
- An element with `role=tablist` holds a set of tab elements
- An element with `role=tabpanel` is specified on the tab content associated with
a tab

The following attributes are implemented:
- `aria-selected` is set to `true` on an element with `role=tab` if it is
selected
- `aria-controls` on the elements with `role=tab` is set to the id of the
associated element with `role=tabpanel`
- `aria-labelledby` on the elements with `role=tabpanel` is set to the id of
the associated element with `role=tab`
- `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` is set on the `tablist` element using the
`Tabs` component props
