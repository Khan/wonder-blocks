# Wonder Blocks Tokens

Wonder Blocks uses a set of tokens to define the look and feel of our
components. These tokens are defined in the `@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-tokens`
package.

Design tokens are a set of key-value pairs that define the visual and behavioral
design attributes of our components. They are the primitives that define the
building blocks of our design system.

These represent the design decisions at Khan Academy, such as:

-  <a href="../?path=/docs/tokens-border--docs">Border</a>
-  <a href="../?path=/docs/tokens-color--docs">Color</a>
-  <a href="../?path=/docs/tokens-spacing--docs">Spacing</a>
-  <a href="../?path=/docs/tokens-typography--docs">Typography</a>
