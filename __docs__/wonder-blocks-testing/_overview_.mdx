# Wonder Blocks Testing

Wonder Blocks Testing provides various utilities to support testing of React components and Wonder Blocks features. It relies on Wonder Blocks Testing Core for much of its functionality. The difference between Wonder Blocks Testing and Wonder Blocks Testing Core is that Wonder Blocks Testing can and does have dependencies on other Wonder Blocks packages, but Wonder Blocks Testing Core should not rely on any other Wonder Blocks packages, making it a safe dependency for those other packages that may need its functionality for their own tests.
