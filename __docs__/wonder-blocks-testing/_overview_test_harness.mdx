# Test Harness

The test harness framework provides a simple approach to minimizing boilerplate when testing React components. It works by allowing for the definition of predefined adapters and configurations that can be rendered around the component under test, encapsulating boilerplate code such as setting up contexts, CSS, or mocking APIs.

There are some [default adapters](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--page) provided as well as default [`testHarness()`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-testharness--page) and [`hookHarness()`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-hookharness--page) methods that use these adapters with meaningful defaults, which can be overridden.

However, it is likely you will want to replace or augment the existing adapters with some of your own. For this purpose, the [`makeTestHarness()`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-maketestharness--page) and [`makeHookHarness()`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-makehookharness--page) methods are provided.
