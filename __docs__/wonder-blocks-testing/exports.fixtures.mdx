# fixtures()

```ts
type FixtureProps<TProps: {...}> =
    | $ReadOnly<TProps>
    | ((options: $ReadOnly<GetPropsOptions>) => $ReadOnly<TProps>);

fixtures<
    TComponent: React.ComponentType<any>,
    TProps: React.ElementConfig<TComponent>,
>(
    Component: TComponent,
): FixtureFn<TProps>;
```

The `fixtures()` method is used to define a set of fixtures for a component. Each fixture is a story compatible with the CSF format used by Storybook.

The method returned by `fixtures(Component)` is a strongly-typed call for generating a named story with the given args, and using the given wrapper component, if provided. See <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-basic--f-1">our Fixtures Framework example stories</a> for examples.

The returned `fixture` function is of type <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-types-fixturefn--docs">`FixtureFn<TProps>`</a>.
