# makeHookHarness()

```ts
makeHookHarness<TAdapters: TestHarnessAdapters>(
    adapters: TAdapters,
    defaultConfigs: TestHarnessConfigs<TAdapters>,
): ((
    configs?: $Shape<TestHarnessConfigs<TAdapters>>,
) => React.AbstractComponent<any, any>);
```

This method takes a set of adapters (such as <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--docs">`harnessAdapters.DefaultAdapters`</a>) and a set of default configurations for those adapters (such as <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--docs">`harnessAdapters.DefaultConfigs`</a>), and returns a function that can be called to create a component that applys those adapters with those default configs, or overrides to those configs.

This returned method can then be used for the `wrapper` option of calls like `renderHook()` from `@testing-library/react-hooks` when writing tests for React hooks.
