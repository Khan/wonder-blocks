# FixtureFn

```ts
/**
 * A function for defining a fixture.
 */
type FixtureFn<TProps: {...}> = (
    /**
     * The name of the fixture.
     */
    description: string,

    /**
     * The props for the fixture or a function that returns the props.
     * The function is injected with an API to facilitate logging.
     */
    props: FixtureProps<TProps>,

    /**
     * An alternative component to render for the fixture.
     * Useful if the fixture requires some additional setup for testing the
     * component.
     */
    wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>,
) => mixed;

```

The <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-exports-fixtures--docs">`fixtures`</a> method returns a method of this type, specific to the component that was passed into `fixtures`.

This function takes two or three arguments:

-   `description: string`: A string describing the fixture. This should be used to explain what the fixture is expected to show.
-   `props: FixtureProps<TProps>`: The props that the fixture should be rendered with. See <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-types-fixtureprops--docs">`FixtureProps`</a>.
-   `wrapper?: React.ComponentType<TProps>`: An optional component that will be rendered for the fixture. This can be used to wrap the fixture in a component that adds additional functionality, such as a test harness (see <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-test-harness-exports-maketestharness--docs">`makeTestHarness`</a>).
