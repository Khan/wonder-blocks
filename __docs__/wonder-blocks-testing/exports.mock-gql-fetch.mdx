# mockGqlFetch()

```ts
mockGqlFetch(): GqlFetchMockFn;
```

The `mockGqlFetch` function provides an API to easily mock GraphQL responses for use with the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-graphql--docs">Wonder Blocks Data GraphQL API</a>. It follows the similar patterns of `jest.fn()` and jest mocks whereby the returned value is both a proxy for the fetch function that is used by <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-exports-gqlrouter--docs">`GqlRouter`</a> as well as an API for modifying the behavior of that function.

# API

Besides being a function that fits the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-data-types-gqlfetchfn--docs">`GqlFetchFn`</a> signature, the return value of `mockGqlFetch()` has an API to customize the behavior of that function. Used in conjunction with the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-mocking-exports-respondwith--docs">`RespondWith`</a> API, this can create a variety of GraphQL responses for testing and stories.

| Function            | Purpose                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mockOperation`     | When called, any GraphQL operation that matches the defined mock operation will respond with the given response.                                   |
| `mockOperationOnce` | When called, the first GraphQL operation that matches the defined mock operation will respond with the given response. The mock is only used once. |

Both of these functions have the same signature:

```ts
type GqlMockOperationFn = <
    TData: {...},
    TVariables: {...},
    TContext: GqlContext,
    TResponseData: GraphQLJson<TData>,
>(
    operation: GqlMockOperation<TData, TVariables, TContext>,
    response: MockResponse<TResponseData>,
) => GqlFetchMockFn;
```

# Operation Matching

The `matchOperation` parameter given to a `mockOperation` or `mockOperationOnce` function is a `GqlMockOperation` defining the actual GraphQL operation to be matched by the mock. The variables and context of the mocked operation change how the mock is matched against requests.

```ts
type GqlMockOperation<
    TData: {...},
    TVariables: {...},
    TContext: GqlContext,
> = {|
    operation: GqlOperation<TData, TVariables>,
    variables?: TVariables,
    context?: TContext,
|};
```

1. When `matchOperation.operation` is present but `matchOperation.variables` and `matchOperation.context` are not, the mock will match any request for the
   same operation, regardless of variables or context on the request.
2. When `matchOperation.variables` is present but `matchOperation.context` is not, the mock will match any request for the same operation with matching variables, regardless of context on the request.
3. When `matchOperation.context` is present but `matchOperation.variables` is not, the mock will match any request for the same operation with matching context, regardless of variables on the request.
4. When `matchOperation.variables` and `matchOperation.context` are present, the mock will match any request for the same operation with matching variables and context.
