# MockResponse\<>

```ts
type MockResponse<TJson> = {|
    toPromise: () => Promise<Response>,
|};
```

This type specifies a mock response. Values of this type are generated by the [`RespondWith`](/docs/testing-mocking-exports-respondwith--page) API. The type parameter is included to allow uses to enforce if they only support `MockResponses` that resolve to a specific JSON pattern.

The `toPromise` method can be used to generate a new promise from the mocked response definition. Note that `toPromise` will always generate a new promise and any promise created will settle according to any signal passed to the corresponding `RespondWith` API call.
