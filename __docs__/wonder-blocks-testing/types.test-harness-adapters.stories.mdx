# TestHarnessAdapters

```ts
type TestHarnessAdapters = {|
    [adapterID: string]: TestHarnessAdapter<any>,
|};
```

Defines a generic collection of test harness adapters.

Only use `TestHarnessAdapters` in input locations to verify a set of adapters conforms to that type, but avoid using it in output locations as it can erase useful type information.

For example, the [`harnessAdapters.DefaultAdapters`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--page) type is specific to the adapters it contains.

```ts
const DefaultAdapters = {
    css: css.adapter,
    data: data.adapter,
    portal: portal.adapter,
    router: router.adapter,
};
```

`DefaultAdapters` is not strongly typed to `TestHarnessAdapters`. Instead, its type is:

```ts
type DefaultAdaptersType = {|
   css: typeof css.adapter,
   data: typeof data.adapter,
   portal: typeof portal.adapter,
   router: typeof router.adapter,
|};
```

It conforms to the `TestHarnessAdapters` type because each key is a string and the value of each property is a variation of `TestHarnessAdapter<TConfig>` with a different type for `TConfig` in each case, but it is not equivalent to the `TestHarnessAdapters` type where each key is a string and each value is exactly `TestHarnessAdapter<any>`.
