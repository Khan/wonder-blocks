# renderHookStatic()

```ts
renderHookStatic<Result, Props>(
    render: (initialProps?: Props) => Result,
    {wrapper, initialProps}: Options<Props> = {},
): RenderHookStaticResult<Result>;
```

This method is a companion to `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react`. It renders uses `renderToString` from `react-dom/server` to render the hook. The result of the hook is then provided via the returned result object. This is useful for verifying how a hook renders on the very first initial render cycle, such as when server-side rendering, or when rendering for the first time on the client.

`renderHookStatic` is intended as a simple replacement for the `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-hooks/server`. The main difference is that it does not support capturing errors as part of its render; to do that, use in conjunction with a hook test harness such as <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-test-harness-exports-hookharness--docs">`hookHarness`</a> and the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--docs#boundary">`boundary`</a> adapter, which adds an error boundary around the rendering hook.

This method can be used to create a test harness for use with the `wrapper` option of calls like `renderHook()` from `@testing-library/react-hooks` when writing tests for React hooks.
