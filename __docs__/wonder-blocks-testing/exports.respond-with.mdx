The `RespondWith` object is a helper for defining mock responses to use with
mock request methods such as [`mockGqlFetch`](/docs/testing-mocking-exports-mockgqlfetch--page).

Each call takes an optional `signal` that can be used to control when the promise generated from the call resolves. See [`SettleController`](/docs/testing-mocking-exports-settlecontroller--page) for related information.
