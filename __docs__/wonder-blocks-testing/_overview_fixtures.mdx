# Fixtures

The fixtures framework provides a way to declare CSF/Storybook-compatible stories with props type checking (something that is easy to forget when using the standard story API).

To use the framework for defining fixtures, import the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-exports-fixtures--docs">`fixtures()`</a> method.

Some examples of this framework in use with Storybook can be seen <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-fixtures-basic--f-1">here</a>.
