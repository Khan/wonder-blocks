# Mocking

Wonder Blocks Testing provides support for mocking the Wonder Blocks Data GraphQL fetching via the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-mocking-exports-mockgqlfetch--docs">`mockGqlFetch()`</a> export, and `fetch()`-like methods via the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-mocking-exports-mockFetch--docs">`mockFetch()`</a> export. These are both supported by the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-mocking-exports-respondwith--docs">`RespondWith`</a> API for easily generating the responses.
