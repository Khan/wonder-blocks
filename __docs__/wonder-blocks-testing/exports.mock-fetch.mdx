# mockFetch()

```ts
mockFetch(): FetchMockFn;
```

The `mockFetch` function provides an API to easily mock `fetch()` responses. It follows the similar patterns of `jest.fn()` and jest mocks whereby the returned value is both a proxy for the fetch function as well as an API for modifying the behavior of that function.

# API

Besides being a function that fits the `fetch()` signature, the return value of `mockFetch()` has an API to customize the behavior of that function. Used in conjunction with the <a href="./?path=/docs/packages-testing-mocking-exports-respondwith--docs">`RespondWith`</a> API, this can create a variety of responses for tests and stories.

| Function            | Purpose                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mockOperation`     | When called, any request that matches the defined mock will respond with the given response.                                   |
| `mockOperationOnce` | When called, the first request that matches the defined mock will respond with the given response. The mock is only used once. |

Both of these functions have the same signature:

```ts
type FetchMockOperationFn = (
    operation: FetchMockOperation,
    response: MockResponse<any>,
) => FetchMockFn;
```

# Operation Matching

The `FetchMockOperation` type is either of type `string` or `RegExp`. When specified as a string, the URL of the request must match the string exactly. When specified as a regular expression, the URL of the request must match the regular expression.
