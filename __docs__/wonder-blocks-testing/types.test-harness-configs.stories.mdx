# TestHarnessConfigs&lt;&gt;

```ts
type TestHarnessConfigs<TAdapters: TestHarnessAdapters>;
```

When given the type of a set of adapters conforming to [`TestHarnessAdapters`](/docs/testing-test-harness-types-testharnessadapters--page), this type will represent a set of configurations for those adapters.

It is important to note here that if the `TAdapters` type passed in is the actual `TestHarnessAdapters` type, then the resulting configuration type will have each adapter's config being set to `any`. Instead of using the `TestHarnessAdapters` type directly, the passed object should not be typed as that, but should merely conform to that type.

For example, the [`harnessAdapters.DefaultAdapters`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--page) type is specific to the adapters it contains.

```ts
const DefaultAdapters = {
    css: css.adapter,
    data: data.adapter,
    portal: portal.adapter,
    router: router.adapter,
};
```

`DefaultAdapters` is not strongly typed to `TestHarnessAdapters`. Instead, its type is:

```ts
type DefaultAdaptersType = {|
   css: typeof css.adapter,
   data: typeof data.adapter,
   portal: typeof portal.adapter,
   router: typeof router.adapter,
|};
```

It conforms to the `TestHarnessAdapters` type, but it is not equivalent to the `TestHarnessAdapters` type. This is important when we consider the companion export, [`harnessAdapters.DefaultConfigs`](/docs/testing-test-harness-exports-harnessadapters--page).

```ts
const DefaultConfigs: TestHarnessConfigs<typeof DefaultAdapters> = {
    css: css.defaultConfig,
    data: data.defaultConfig,
    portal: portal.defaultConfig,
    router: router.defaultConfig,
};
```

`DefaultConfigs` is typed using `TestHarnessConfigs<typeof DefaultAdapters>`. Because `DefaultAdapters` is strongly typed specifically to each adapter it contains, the type that `TestHarnessConfigs<>` creates ensures that there is one configuration per adapter key, and that the configuration type for each adapter key is correct for the corresponding adapter.

If we had typed `DefaultAdapters` as `TestHarnessAdapters`, then although we would still enforce one configuration per adapter key, we would allow `any` type to provide that configuration, which does not give us any real type safety.

So, to summarize, use `TestHarnessAdapters` in input locations to verify a set of adapters conforms to that type, but avoid using it in output locations as it can erase useful type information.
