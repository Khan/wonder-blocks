# FetchMockFn

```ts
type FetchMockFn = {|
    (input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestOptions): Promise<Response>,
    mockOperation: FetchMockOperationFn,
    mockOperationOnce: FetchMockOperationFn,
|};
```

This type represents the mocking API for `fetch()`. It is the type of the function returned by the [`mockFetch()`](/docs/testing-mocking-exports-mockfetch--page), which is both a drop in replacement for a `fetch()`-like method, but also exposes the mocking API for configuration additional mocks.
