## Overview

Since our design system is a constant work in progress, these components vary in
degrees of completion. Follow these guidelines to ensure the smoothest process
from design to development:

- Some components currently have limitations, so read the guidelines carefully
  to ensure that you're not designing something that will be difficult (or
  impossible) for your engineers to build.
- Some components aren't complete yet, so while you may see that component
  being used in the wild, know that these aren't official components yet. As
  such, they haven't been stress-tested and may not meet the quality standards
  your team needs (eg, they may not be built with accessibility in mind). They
  could also be difficult for your engineering team to build, so check with
  them early on.
- A component you need may not be listed in here, in which case you're more
  than welcome to propose it to the design systems team.
