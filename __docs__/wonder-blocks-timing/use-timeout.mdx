# `useTimeout`

`useTimeout` is a hook that provides a convenient API for setting and clearing
a timeout. It is defined as follows:

```ts
function useTimeout(
    action: () => mixed,
    timeoutMs: number,
    options?: {|
        schedulePolicy?: SchedulePolicy,
        clearPolicy?: ClearPolicy,
        actionPolicy?: ActionPolicy,
    |},
): ITimeout;

interface ITimeout {
    get isSet(): boolean;
    set(): void;
    clear(policy?: ClearPolicy): void;
}
```

By default the timeout will be set immediately up creation. The `options` parameter can
be used to control when when the timeout is schedule and whether or not `action` should be
called when the timeout is cleared.

Notes:

-   Because `clear` takes a param, it's important that you don't pass it directly to an event handler,
    e.g. `<Button onClick={clear} />` will not work as expected.
-   Calling `set` after the timeout has expired will restart the timeout.
-   Updating the second paramter, `timeoutMs`, will also restart the timeout.
-   When the component using this hooks is unmounted, the timeout will automatically be cleared.
-   Calling `set` after the timeout is set but before it expires means that the timeout will be
    reset and will call `action`, `timeoutMs` after the most recent call to `set` was made.
