# Accessibility

## Using `LabeledField` with `MultiSelect`

To associate a `MultiSelect` with another visible element (e.g. a `<label>`),
wrap it in a `LabeledField` component. The label will apply to the `MultiSelect`
opener. With `LabeledField`, you can supply label text (or a JSX node)
using the `label` prop to generate a paired `<label>` element. It comes with
field validation and other features baked in!

If for some reason you can't use `LabeledField` for a visible label, you can still
make `MultiSelect` accessible in a screen reader by associating it with `<label for="">`.
Pass the `id` of the `MultiSelect` to the `for` attribute.

Alternatively, you can create an accessible name for `MultiSelect` using `aria-labelledby`.
Put `aria-labelledby` on `MultiSelect` pointing to the `id` of any other element.
It won't give you the same enhanced click target as a paired `<label>`, but it still
helps to create a more accessible experience.

## Using `aria-label` for the opener and/or child options

A visible label with `<LabeledField>` is preferred. However, for specific cases
where the `MultiSelect` is not paired with a `LabeledField` or other visible
`<label>` element, you **must** supply an `aria-label` attribute for an
accessible name on the opener.

This will ensure the `MultiSelect` as a whole has a name that describes its purpose.

Also, if you need screen readers to understand relevant information on
option items, you can use `aria-label` on each item. e.g. You can use it to let
screen readers know the current selected/unselected status of the item when it
receives focus. This can be useful when the options contain icons or other information
that would need to be omitted from the visible label.
