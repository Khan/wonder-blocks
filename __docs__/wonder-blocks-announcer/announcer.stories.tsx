/**
 * > ðŸŒ± **Note:** This is a new package. We would love your feedback on it!
 *
 * Announcer exposes an API for screen reader messages using [ARIA Live Regions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#attrs_liveregions).
 * It can be used to notify Assistive Technology users without moving
 * keyboard focus. Use cases include combobox filtering, toast notifications,
 * client-side routing, and more.
 *
 * Announcer is an ES6 class that creates a singleton instance. It can be
 * optionally configured once per page load with the `initAnnouncer` function.
 * Calling `announceMessage` will automatically create this instance if not
 * already present.
 *
 * Messages alternate between one of two live regions per level (`polite` and `assertive`).
 * They are automatically cleared from the DOM after a `5000` ms delay.
 *
 * To test the Announcer, turn on VoiceOver for Mac/iOS or NVDA on Windows and play with the [React example below](#react-announcer-example).
 *
 * By default, the `wbAnnouncer` container element is rendered _visually hidden_.
 *
 * > In Storybook, the Live Regions appended by Announcer are shown visually on the
 * right side of the screen for debugging (see red outlined boxes). This can be
 * controlled with a Storybook parameter, `addBodyClass: "showAnnouncer"`.
 *
 * ## API functions
 * ### announceMessage(options)
 *
 * Calling the `announceMessage` function automatically appends the live regions
 * to `document.body` by default.
 *
 * #### Options object
 * - **message:** `string` (required) The text to be announced in a screen reader
 *
 * - **level:** `assertive` or `polite` (default)<br>
 *      Whether to interrupt other messages before making an announcement or wait until the system queue is clear.
 *
 * - **debounceThreshold** `number` (default `250` ms)<br>
 *      Specific duration to wait before making another announcement. This is helpful
 *      to prevent too many messages in a dynamic render cycle. Uses trailing edge debounce where last message wins.
 *
 * - **initialTimeout** `number` (default `150` ms)<br>
 *      Optional duration to wait before the first announcement, used for Safari and automated testing.
 *
 * #### Returns
 * A promise resolving with the string ID of the last targeted live region element, such as `wbARegion-polite1`.
 *
 * ####  Usage
 *
 * Calling `announceMessage` in an event handler:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { announceMessage } from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-announcer";
 *
 * <div>
 *      <button onClick={() => announceMessage({message: 'Saved your work for you.'})}>
 *          Save
 *      </button>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Calling `announceMessage` in React.useEffect() when state changes:
 *
 *```jsx
 *  import { announceMessage } from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-announcer";
 *
 * const MyComponent = () => {
 *      React.useEffect(() => {
 *          if (someState) {
 *              announceMessage({message: "A thing!"});
 *          }
 *      }, [someState]);
 *
 *      return (
 *          <div>Some content</div>
 *      )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### initAnnouncer(options)

The `initAnnouncer` function can be optionally called to inject live regions on page load.

This can help with consistency of screen reader messages as live regions
should ideally be present on the page before making announcements.

Without this optional configuration, the live regions will be injected the first
time `announceMessage` is called. This is sufficient for many use cases, and can be
determined through screen reader testing (especially with VoiceOver and Safari).

With the `targetElement` option, you can configure the Announcer to inject into a specific element.
Otherwise it will default to `document.body` (without the `targetElement` property).

#### Usage
```jsx
 * import { useRef } from "React";
 * import { initAnnouncer } from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-announcer";
 *
 * const LayoutComponent = () => {
 *      const containerRef = useRef(null);
 *
 *      initAnnouncer({
 *          targetElement: containerRef.current // optional: defaults to document.body
 *      })
 *
 *      return (
 *          <div ref={containerRef}>
 *              <div>...</div>
 *              <--  wbAnnouncer will be injected here -->
 *          </div>
 *      )
 * }
 * ```
