# Accessibility

The Popover component should follow these guidelines:

**Trigger Element:**

-   It should have a role of button (e.g. `<button>`).
-   When the content is visible, it's recommended to set
    [aria-expanded](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-expanded) to true.
    When content is hidden,
    [aria-expanded](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-expanded) is set to
    false.
-   It should reference the content using the
    [aria-controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-controls) attribute.

**Popover Dialog:**

The popover component will populate the
[aria-labelledby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-labelledby) and
[aria-describedby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby)
attributes automatically. Internally, it will be set in the `dialog` element and
the `PopoverContent` component to reference the `title` and `content`
elements/props. By doing this, the popover will be announced by screen readers
as a dialog with a title and content.

## Keyboard Interaction

### Initial focus

**NOTE:** This only applies when the popover is opened by clicking on a trigger
element.

When a popover is opened via a button, focus moves to an element inside the
Popover. The initial focus placement depends on the following scenarios:

1. initialFocusId (default): Popover exposes this prop as a string. The popover
   itself will try to find this element into the DOM. If it's found, focus is
   initially set on this element.

2. focusable elements: This is the second scenario, where the popover tries to
   find the first occurrence of possible focusable elements.

3. Popover: If the first two conditions are not met, then focus is initially set
   to the popover container.

### Focus management

Once focus is in the popover, users can access controls within the popover
using:

1. **`tab`**: Moves focus to the next focusable element.

    **NOTE:** If the focus has reached the last focusable element inside the
    popover, the next tab will set focus on the next focusable element that
    exists after the PopoverAnchor.

2. **`shift + tab`**: Moves focus to the previous focusable element.

    **NOTE:** If the focus is set to the first focusable element inside the
    popover, the next shift + tab will set focus on the PopoverAnchor element.

### Dismissing the popover

When a popover dialog closes, focus should return to the anchor element defined
in the Popover children prop.
