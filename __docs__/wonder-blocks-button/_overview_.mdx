# Button

The `wonder-blocks-button` package provides a set of button components that
allow you to create buttons with text and optional icons. These buttons are
designed to be accessible and easy to use, with support for keyboard navigation
and screen readers.

For more details about each type of Button, refer to the docs for that
component!

## Button

A simple button that can be used to trigger actions or navigate to other pages.
It uses a flat design, our most common design pattern that can be used across
different experiences.
