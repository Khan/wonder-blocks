## Accessibility

### Labeling

`Button` has an accessible label by default. The accessible name is computed from
the `children` prop. However, `aria-label` should be used when `spinner={true}`
to let people using screen readers that the action taken by clicking the button
will take some time to complete.

This is an example of a component with an accessible label:

<Canvas of={AccessibilityStories.Labeling} />

### Disabled state

Buttons do not need an `aria-disabled` attribute, if it also has a `disabled`
attribute. Users operating the web page through a screen reader may not be able
to fully evaluate the implied behaviors of the button element itself.

<Canvas of={AccessibilityStories.DisabledState} />
