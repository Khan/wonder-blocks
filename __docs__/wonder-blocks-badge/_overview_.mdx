# Badges

Badges are visual indicators used to display concise information, such as a
status, label, or count.

The `wonder-blocks-badge` packages has several types of badges. For more details
about each type of badge, refer to the docs for that component!

## StatusBadge

A badge that represents a status.

## NeutralBadge

A badge that displays information without conveying additional meaning through
its visual presentation.

<Canvas of={NeutralBadgeStories.Default} />

## GemBadge

A badge that represents gems.

<Canvas of={GemBadgeStories.Default} />

## StreakBadge

A badge that represents a streak.

<Canvas of={StreakBadgeStories.Default} />

## DueBadge

A badge that represents when something is due or overdue.

## Badge (Custom Badges)

For custom badges, the `Badge` component can be used directly. The styles can be
overridden using the `styles` prop.
