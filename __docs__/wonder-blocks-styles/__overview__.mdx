# Wonder Blocks Styles

Wonder Blocks Styles provides a set of styles that can be used to style your
components. These styles are defined in the `@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-styles`
package.

These styles are meant to be used as global patterns for styling your
components. They are not meant to be used as a replacement for our own Wonder
Blocks components. Please use WB components whenever possible, then use these
styles as a last resort to enforce consistency across experiences.

<View style={{marginBlock: spacing.medium_16}}>
    <Banner
        kind="info"
        text="We highly recommend using existing Wonder Blocks components instead of
        creating your own components. Use these styles to augment existing components
        when necessary."
    />
