# Card Accessibility

- When using `tag="section"` or `tag="figure"`, the `labels.cardAriaLabel` prop is required to provide an accessible name for the card.
- When the `onDismiss` prop is provided, a dismiss button will be rendered. In this case, the `labels.dismissButtonAriaLabel` prop is required to provide an accessible label for the dismiss button.
- Cards cannot be interactive elements themselves (e.g. buttons or links), but they can contain interactive elements as children.

## HTML Semantics

By default, cards render as `<div>` elements. However, you can specify a different semantic element using the `tag` prop:

- `tag="section"` - Use when the card represents a distinct section of content. Requires an accessible name via `labels.cardAriaLabel`.
- `tag="figure"` - Use when the card contains media or illustrated content. Accepts an accessible name via `labels.cardAriaLabel`.
- `tag="article"` - Use when the card represents standalone content
- `tag="li"` - Use when cards are part of a list (see notes about `inert` below)

## Dismiss Button

When `onDismiss` is provided, an accessible dismiss button is automatically added:

- The button has `aria-label` set from `labels.dismissButtonAriaLabel`
- The button is positioned in the top-right corner of the card (with support for RTL languages)
- Focus management should be handled by the consuming application when the card is dismissed

## Inert Cards

The `inert` prop can be used to remove cards from the accessibility tree and keyboard tab order:

- Useful for inactive cards in a stack or overlay
- Sets the `inert` attribute on the card container
- All interactive elements within the card become non-focusable

See the [In a Stack](./?path=/story/packages-card-card--in-a-stack) story for an example of disabling cards while keeping them part of a list count, like End-of-Task cards.

## Best Practices

- Ensure cards have a logical heading structure when they contain headings
- If cards are part of a collection, consider using appropriate container semantics (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `role="list"`)
- When cards are dismissible, ensure focus is moved to an appropriate element after dismissal
- Use meaningful accessible names for semantic card tags (`section`, `figure`)
