# Card Accessibility

Cards cannot be interactive elements themselves (e.g. buttons or links), but they can contain interactive elements as children.

## HTML Semantics

By default, cards render as `<div>` elements. However, you can specify a different semantic element using the `tag` prop:

- `tag="section"` - Use when the card represents a distinct section of content. Accepts an accessible name via `labels.cardAriaLabel`.
- `tag="figure"` - Use when the card contains media or illustrated content. Accepts an accessible name via `labels.cardAriaLabel`.
- `tag="article"` - Use when the card represents standalone content
- `tag="li"` - Use when cards are part of a list (see notes about `inert` below)

## Labeling cards

When using semantic tags like `tag="section"` or `tag="figure"`, you should provide an accessible name for the Card using one of the following (in order of preference):

 1. `labels.cardAriaLabel`: preferred for translatable strings. See the Dismiss Button section below for more.
 2. `aria-labelledby`: for ID references to existing elements.
 3. `aria-label`: also allowed as a fallback - `labels.cardAriaLabel` automatically applies this attribute.

When the `onDismiss` prop is provided, a dismiss button will be rendered. In this case, the `labels.dismissButtonAriaLabel` prop is required to provide a translatable, accessible label for the dismiss button.

## Dismiss Button

When `onDismiss` is provided, an accessible dismiss button is automatically added:

- The button has `aria-label` set from `labels.dismissButtonAriaLabel`
- The button is positioned in the top-right corner of the card (with support for RTL languages)
- Focus management should be handled by the consuming application when the card is dismissed

## Inert Cards

The `inert` prop can be used to remove cards from the accessibility tree and keyboard tab order:

- Useful for inactive cards in a stack or overlay
- Sets the `inert` attribute on the card container
- All interactive elements within the card become non-focusable

See the In a Stack story for an example of disabling cards while keeping them part of a list count, like End-of-Task cards.

## Best Practices

- Ensure cards have a logical heading structure when they contain headings.
- If cards are part of a collection, consider wrapping them with appropriate container semantics (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `role="list"`).
- When cards are dismissible, ensure focus is moved to an appropriate element after dismissal.
- When applicable, use meaningful accessible names for semantic landmark tags (`section`, `figure`) so they show in the VoiceOver Rotor and NVDA Elements List.
