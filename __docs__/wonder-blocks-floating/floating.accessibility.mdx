# Accessibility for Floating

## Guidelines

Please verify that the intended widget is already part of Wonder Blocks.

- Combobox: use the `SingleSelect`, `MultiSelect` or `Combobox` components.
- Popover: use the `Popover` component.
- Tooltip: use the `Tooltip` component.
- Menu: use the `ActionMenu` component.
- Dialog: use the `OnePaneDialog` or `FlexibleDialog` components with
  `ModalLauncher`.

If you are definitively needing a floating element, please follow these
guidelines:

- Make sure that the reference element is interactive and focusable.
- Include the proper ARIA attributes on both the reference and floating
  elements.
- If the floating element is a popup, set the `role` prop to "dialog".
- If the floating element is a popup, set the `aria-labelledby` attribute to
  the id of the reference element.
- If the floating element is a popup, set the `aria-expanded` attribute in
  the reference element to define the open state of the floating element.
- Make sure to include `aria-haspopup` or `aria-controls` attributes on the
  reference element (it depends on the type of floating element).
