## Accessibility

### Labeling

`Breadcrumbs` has an `aria-label` prop that sets the accessible name on the
the component. By default, this is "Breadcrumbs" as per recommended guidelines.

This is an example of a component with an accessible label:

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Default} />

### Nav Role

Breadcrumbs are `nav` elements. They show up as navigation landmarks to
screen readers.

### Current Page

Guidelines state that the last link in a list of breadcrumbs (the last
`BreadcrumbsItem`) should have the attribute `aria-current="page"` to
indicate that it represents the current page. The implementation already
sets `aria-current="page` to the last element, so developers do not need
to add it themeselves.
