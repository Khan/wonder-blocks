# Get Started

## Design

The design system components are available in Figma:
- <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/EuFu0U7gqc1koXm8ZhlOLp/%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F-Components?node-id=1-2">Wonder Blocks Component Library (Thunderblocks)</a>
- <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/VbVu3h2BpBhH80niq101MHHE/%F0%9F%92%A0-Main-Components?node-id=4249-1689">Original Wonder Blocks Component Library (Classic)</a>

For the most part, the Figma components should have an equivalent code component.
Reach out to the Wonder Blocks team if you have any questions on how to implement
a design using the code components!

## Development

### Installation

#### Setting up Wonder Blocks
1. Install the <a href="https://github.com/Khan/wonder-blocks/blob/main/packages/wonder-blocks-core/package.json">`peerDependencies`</a> for the `wonder-blocks-core` package:
```shell
pnpm install aphrodite@^1.2.5 react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 react-router@5.3.4 react-router-dom@5.3.4 react-router-dom-v5-compat@^6.30.0
```
2. Install the `wonder-blocks-core` and `wonder-blocks-tokens` packages:
- The <a href="/?path=/docs/packages-core-overview--docs">Core package</a> provides
building blocks and helpful utilities for
constructing components
- The <a href="/?path=/docs/packages-tokens-overview--docs">Tokens package</a> provides
tokens that define the look and feel of the design system. When implementing
features in an application, use these tokens so that it follows the principles
and theming of the design system.
```shell
pnpm install @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-core @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-tokens
```

#### Importing Styles
1. Import the styles from the tokens package. These styles are necessary since
they include the CSS variables used in Wonder Blocks.

```css
// styles.css
@import "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-tokens/styles.css";
```

#### Typography
1. Set the root font size to `62.5%` so that `1rem` is equal to `10px`. Many of
the Wonder Blocks components and typography use rems based on this unit.

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}
```

2. More details to come on how to import fonts!

#### Theming

1. Install the theming package:
```shell
pnpm install @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-theming
```
2. Wrap the root of your application with the <a href="/?path=/docs/packages-theming-themeswitcher--docs">Theme Switcher</a>
component. The theme can be set using the `theme` prop. Any descendants of this
that uses Wonder Blocks components or tokens will have styling for the selected
theme!

```tsx
// App.tsx

import {ThemeSwitcher} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-theming";

export const App = () => {
    return (
        <ThemeSwitcher theme="thunderblocks">
            {/* The application contents */}
        </ThemeSwitcher>
    );
};

```

#### Icons

We currently use icons from <a href="https://phosphoricons.com/">Phosphor Icons</a> or
custom icons.

##### Phosphor Icons

1. Install Phosphor Icons and the WB Icon packages
```shell
pnpm install @phosphor-icons/core @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon
```
2. Import an icon from the Phosphor Icon library
```ts
import magnifyingGlassIcon from "@phosphor-icons/core/regular/magnifying-glass.svg";
```
3. Use with the Wonder Blocks <a href="/?path=/docs/packages-icon-phosphoricon--docs">PhosphorIcon</a>
component or other Wonder Blocks components that support Phosphor icons like Button,
IconButton, Banner, etc.

```tsx
import magnifyingGlassIcon from "@phosphor-icons/core/regular/magnifying-glass.svg";
import {PhosphorIcon} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon";

const icon = (
    <PhosphorIcon
        icon={magnifyingGlassIcon}
        size="medium"
    />
);

const iconButton = (
    <IconButton
        icon={magnifyingGlassIcon}
        aria-label="An Icon"
        onClick={(e) => console.log("Hello, world!")}
        size="medium"
    />
);
```

##### Custom Icons

1. Install the Wonder Blocks Icon package
```shell
pnpm install @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon
```
2. Import the icon asset.
- For custom icon assets, consider using semantic color tokens in inline svgs so
that the icon properly responds to theming in the system
- Note: The Wonder Blocks Icon package also includes a set of
<a href="/?path=/docs/packages-icon-custom-icon-components--docs">common custom icon assets</a>.

```tsx
import {GemIcon} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon";
import customIcon from "./custom-icon.svg";
```

3. Use with the <a href="/?path=/docs/packages-icon-icon--docs">Wonder Blocks Icon</a>
component or other Wonder Blocks components that support Phosphor icons like Button,
IconButton, Banner, etc.
```tsx
import {GemIcon} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon";
import customIcon from "./custom-icon.svg";

const gemIcon = (
    <Icon size="large">
        <GemIcon aria-label="Gems" />
    </Icon>
);

const customAssetIcon = (
    <Icon size="large">
        {customIcon}
    </Icon>
);

const gemIconButton = (
    <IconButton
        icon={<GemIcon />}
        aria-label="Gems"
        onClick={(e) => console.log("Hello, world!")}
        size="medium"
    />
)
```

#### Components

1. Install the package you need for a specific Wonder Blocks component. The
package name can be found in the docs for a component.

For example, to use the Wonder Blocks Button component, we would need to install
the `@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-button` component.

```bash
pnpm install @khanacademy/wonder-blocks-button
```

2. Install any other peer dependencies for that package.

3. Read the component docs for information about best practices, guidelines, and
common examples!
