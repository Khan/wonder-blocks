# Icon Utilities

## `useImageRoleAttributes(props)` hook

```tsx
import {useImageRoleAttributes} from "@khanacademy/wonder-blocks-icon";
```

### Description

The `useImageRoleAttributes` hook determines what attributes should be applied
to an element that represents as image, such as an `svg` element or a `span`
with a `background-image`.

**This hook should not be used with `img` elements. Use the `alt` attribute on
`img` tags instead!**

How it works:
- If an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` is provided, it will be used and the
attributes will include `role="img"`. This means the icon conveys meaning and
will communicate the label to screen reader users.
- If neither of these are provided, the attributes will include `aria-hidden=true`.
This means that the icon is decorative only and should not be communicated to
screen reader users.

### Arguments

- `props`: An object that contains:
```tsx
type Props = {
    "aria-label"?: string
    "aria-labelledby"?: string
}
```

### Returns

The hook returns an object of HTML attributes that should be applied to an
`svg` element.

### Examples

#### With Label

This example shows how to use the hook to get attributes for the icon. It also
logs the attributes provided by the hook. It provides an `aria-label` for the
hook. When using a screen reader, the label is communicated to the user.

This is useful for scenarios where an icon conveys meaning.

<Canvas of={IconUtilitiesStories.UseImageRoleAttributesWithLabel} />

#### With No Label

This example shows the behaviour when no label is passed to the hook. When
using a screen reader, the icon is not communicated to the user.

This is useful for scenarios where an icon is decorative only.

<Canvas of={IconUtilitiesStories.UseImageRoleAttributesWithNoLabel} />
