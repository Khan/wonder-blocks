## Icon Accessibility

### Rules of Thumb

* Use familiar or commonly used icons.
* Each icon should convey a single meaning.
* Icons should be easy to see.
* The color contrast should pass WCAG.
  * At least 3:1 contrast ratio for icons.
* Ideally, an icon should be accompanied by text. However, if an icon
  is not accompanied by text, provide an `aria-label`.
  * If you are using `aria-label`, make sure to also use `role="img"` so that
    screen readers know that the element is an image and not just decorative
    text.
  * If the icon is decorative, set `aria-hidden` to `true` and do not provide an
   `aria-label`. This will hide the icon from screen readers.
  * The `title` attribute is often used to display a description on mouse
    hover, but please note that use of the `title` attribute is discouraged
    as titles are not available to keyboard-only or touch-only users.
    More information can be found in the [References](#references) below.
* Icons should go on the opposite side as left-to-right languages
  for right-to-left languages.
  * The icon may also need to be mirrored.

More information about all these points can be found in the
[References](#references) below.
