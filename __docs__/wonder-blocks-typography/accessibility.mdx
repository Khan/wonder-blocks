## Typography Accessibility

### Rules of Thumb

* The font size should be large enough for the text to be readable. The
  font size for the Wonder Blocks Typography `Body` element is currently
  set to be 16px. Headings are even larger.
  * Each Wonder Blocks Typography component has its own predetermined
    font size - this cannot be updated by the user via the `styles` prop.
* The color contrast should pass WCAG.
  * "WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for
    normal text and 3:1 for large text." [(Contrast Checker, WebAIM)](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
* It is best to use a familiar font that is easy to read. By default,
  most Wonder Blocks Typography elements use Lato (a sans-serif font) for
  Latin-based languages, and Noto for Non-Latin languages such as Arabic,
  Armenian, Greek, and Hebrew. The `BodySerif` and `BodySerifBlock`
  components use the Noto Serif font.
  * Note that sans-serif fonts are generally recommended for use on web,
    but serif fonts may be preferable for some users, such as users with
    dyslexia.
* There should be adequate line spacing in order to make text easier to read.
  Each Wonder Blocks Typography component has its own predetermined
  line height - this cannot be updated by the user via the `styles` prop.
