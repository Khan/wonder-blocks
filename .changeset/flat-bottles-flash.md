- Removes `khanmigo` theme as it is no longer used.
- Adds `className` prop to `Switch` component to allow custom styling of the switch in Storybook (Chromatic), and to prepare for a future CSS modules integration.
- Modifies the focus outline to use the global `focusStyles.focus` style from `wonder-blocks-styles`.
